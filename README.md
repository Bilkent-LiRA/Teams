# Microsoft Teams Tutorial and Documentation
This documentation is designed to help with Teams' functionalities and decide on the style that will be used on the LiRA lab's Teams channel.
## Creating a Channel
To add a new channel to the designated Teams, first hover over the three dots next to the LiRA in the Teams section.<br />

Then decide on the channel's name and provide a brief description of the channel's purpose. Please be clear about the channel's name and follow the naming convention where all letters should be lowercase and "-" should be used instead of space. If you intend to make this channel public (Standard), please check the box next to "Automatically show this channel in everyoneâ€™s channel list".<br />

### Opt: Creating a Private & Shared Channel
If you decide to open a private or shared channel, please follow the exact steps described above but change the "Privacy" from the dropdown menu to the desired option. Take notice that some integrated apps are not working for channels other than the standard. <br />
